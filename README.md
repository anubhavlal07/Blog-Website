This application is a minor project that I developed during my 5th semester of my Bachelor's degree. It serves as a platform for users to store and display personal blog entries they have written. The application is a Full Stack project, utilizing a combination of technologies to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

The front-end of the application is built using ReactJS and Material-UI (framework) which provides a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Material-UI is a popular framework that provides a set of pre-designed components that help in styling and designing the front-end. This makes it easy to create a consistent and professional-looking user interface.

In the back-end, NodeJS with ExpressJS (framework) is used. ExpressJS is a popular framework that simplifies the process of building back-end applications. The data is stored on a serverless database called MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format. This allows for easy and efficient storage and retrieval of data. Overall, this project is a demonstration of my ability to work with a variety of technologies, and my proficiency in Full Stack development.
